# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your Face Authentication & De-duplication System now has:

1. ✅ **Complete public application form** (no login required)
2. ✅ **Industry-standard routing** (public vs admin)
3. ✅ **Full applicant details collection** (name, email, phone, DOB, address)
4. ✅ **Professional admin portal** (separate login and dashboard)
5. ✅ **Role-based access control** (admin, operator, reviewer)

## 🏃 Start the Application

### 1. Start Backend (Terminal 1)

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Backend will be available at:** `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Start Frontend (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Frontend will be available at:** `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When User Submits Application:

```
1. Frontend validates form
   ↓
2. Sends to: POST /api/v1/applications/upload
   ↓
3. Backend receives:
   - photograph (file)
   - name, email, phone, DOB, address
   ↓
4. Backend processes:
   - Saves to MongoDB
   - Queues for face recognition
   - Returns application ID
   ↓
5. Background processing:
   - Face detection (AI)
   - Face embedding generation
   - Duplicate check (FAISS)
   - Identity assignment
   ↓
6. Status updates:
   - PENDING → PROCESSING → VERIFIED/DUPLICATE
```

## 📊 Check Application Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/applications/{application_id}
```
