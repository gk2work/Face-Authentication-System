# Migration Verification Report

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Migration**: Backend reorganization to monorepo structure

## Configuration Verification

### ✅ Docker Build Configuration

**docker-compose.yml**:

- Build context: `./backend` ✓
- Dockerfile: `Dockerfile` (in backend directory) ✓
- Volume mounts:
  - `./backend/app:/app/app` ✓
  - `./backend/storage:/app/storage` ✓
  - `./backend/logs:/app/logs` ✓

**backend/Dockerfile**:

- WORKDIR: `/app` ✓
- COPY commands use relative paths ✓
- No absolute path references ✓
- All paths relative to build context (backend/) ✓

**Verification Status**: Configuration is correct and ready for Docker build.

**Note**: Docker daemon was not running during verification. Configuration has been manually verified and is correct.

### ✅ Docker Startup Configuration

**Startup Command**: `docker-compose up` (from project root)

**Expected Behavior**:

1. MongoDB container starts and becomes healthy
2. Redis container starts and becomes healthy
3. Backend app container builds and starts
4. API becomes accessible at http://localhost:8000
5. All volume mounts work correctly

**Health Checks**:

- MongoDB: `mongosh localhost:27017/face_auth --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"`
- Redis: `redis-cli ping`
- API: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

**Verification Status**: Configuration verified. Requires Docker daemon to test actual startup.

**Note**: Docker daemon was not running during verification. All configurations have been verified and are correct.

### ✅ Test Suite Configuration

**Test Location**: `backend/tests/`

**Running Tests**:

Tests should be run from within the backend directory context:

```bash
# Option 1: Run from backend directory (local development)
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Option 2: Run in Docker container (recommended)
docker-compose exec app pytest tests/ -v

# Option 3: Using Makefile from project root
make test
```

**Import Structure**: Tests import from `app.*` which requires the Python path to include the backend directory.

**Baseline Comparison**: Tests should match the pre-migration baseline documented in `PRE_MIGRATION_BASELINE.md`:

- 15 tests passing
- 17 tests failing (test implementation issues, not core functionality)
- 3 tests skipped

**Verification Status**: Test structure verified. Tests must be run from backend directory context or within Docker container.

**Note**: Tests cannot be run directly from project root due to Python import paths. This is expected behavior with the monorepo structure.

## Summary

All configuration files have been successfully updated for the backend reorganization:

✅ Docker build context updated to `./backend`
✅ Volume mounts updated to reference `backend/` paths
✅ Dockerfile paths are correct (relative to backend/)
✅ Test structure verified (must run from backend context)
✅ All documentation updated with correct paths

## Testing Checklist

When Docker daemon is available, complete these tests:

- [ ] `docker-compose build` - Build succeeds
- [ ] `docker-compose up` - All containers start
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:8000/health` - API responds
- [ ] `docker-compose exec app pytest tests/` - Tests run
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:8000/docs` - Swagger docs accessible
- [ ] Verify storage paths work (file uploads)
- [ ] Verify logs are written to `backend/logs/`
- [ ] Test all Makefile commands from project root

## Recommendations

1. **Start Docker daemon** and run full integration tests
2. **Run test suite** from within Docker container to verify baseline
3. **Test API endpoints** to ensure all functionality works
4. **Verify storage and logging** paths are working correctly
5. **Test Makefile commands** to ensure they work from project root
