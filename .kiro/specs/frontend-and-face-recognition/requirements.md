# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the Face Authentication and De-duplication System by adding a web-based frontend interface and implementing actual face recognition capabilities. The system will enable operators to upload photographs, process them for face detection and recognition, manage identities, and visualize duplicate detection results through an intuitive user interface.

## Glossary

- **Frontend Application**: A web-based user interface built with React that allows users to interact with the Face Authentication System
- **Face Recognition Engine**: The core component that detects faces in images, generates embeddings, and compares them for similarity
- **Embedding**: A numerical vector representation of a face that can be compared with other embeddings to determine similarity
- **Dashboard**: The main interface showing system statistics, recent applications, and identity management
- **Application Upload**: The process of submitting a photograph for face recognition and duplicate detection
- **Identity Card**: A visual component displaying identity information and associated photographs
- **Similarity Score**: A numerical value (0-1) indicating how similar two faces are
- **Duplicate Detection**: The process of comparing a new face against existing identities to find matches

5. WHEN statistics are updated, THE System SHALL refresh the dashboard data automatically every 30 seconds

### Requirement 4: Application Upload and Management Interface

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to upload photographs and track their processing status, so that I can submit new applications for face recognition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator accesses the upload page, THE System SHALL display a drag-and-drop file upload interface
2. WHEN an operator selects an image file, THE System SHALL validate that the file is a supported image format (JPEG, PNG)
3. WHEN an operator uploads a photograph, THE System SHALL display a preview of the image before submission
4. WHEN an operator submits an application, THE System SHALL show real-time processing status updates
5. WHEN processing completes, THE System SHALL display the results including duplicate detection status and matched identities

### Requirement 5: Identity Management Interface

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to view and manage all identities in the system, so that I can review identity records and their associated photographs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator navigates to the identities page, THE System SHALL display a paginated list of all identities
2. WHEN an operator views an identity, THE System SHALL show all photographs associated with that identity
3. WHEN an operator searches for identities, THE System SHALL filter results based on unique ID or status
4. WHEN an operator selects an identity, THE System SHALL display detailed information including creation date and application history
5. WHERE an identity has multiple photographs, THE System SHALL display them in a gallery view

### Requirement 6: Face Detection Implementation

**User Story:** As the system, I want to detect faces in uploaded photographs, so that I can extract face regions for recognition processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded, THE System SHALL detect all faces present in the photograph
2. WHEN faces are detected, THE System SHALL extract bounding box coordinates for each face
3. IF no faces are detected, THEN THE System SHALL return an error indicating no faces found
4. WHEN multiple faces are detected, THE System SHALL process the largest face by default
5. WHEN face detection completes, THE System SHALL validate that the detected face meets minimum quality thresholds

### Requirement 7: Face Embedding Generation

**User Story:** As the system, I want to generate numerical embeddings from detected faces, so that I can compare faces mathematically for similarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a face is detected, THE System SHALL generate a 512-dimensional embedding vector
2. WHEN embeddings are generated, THE System SHALL use a pre-trained face recognition model (FaceNet or similar)
3. WHEN embeddings are created, THE System SHALL normalize the vectors for consistent comparison
4. WHEN embedding generation fails, THE System SHALL log the error and mark the application as failed
5. WHEN embeddings are generated, THE System SHALL store them in the database associated with the application

### Requirement 8: Duplicate Detection and Matching

**User Story:** As the system, I want to compare new face embeddings against existing identities, so that I can detect duplicate applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new embedding is generated, THE System SHALL compare it against all existing identity embeddings
2. WHEN comparing embeddings, THE System SHALL calculate cosine similarity scores
3. IF a similarity score exceeds the threshold (0.85), THEN THE System SHALL flag the application as a duplicate
4. WHEN duplicates are detected, THE System SHALL return the matched identity ID and confidence score
5. WHEN no duplicates are found, THE System SHALL create a new identity for the application

### Requirement 9: Image Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As the system, I want to assess the quality of uploaded photographs, so that I can reject poor-quality images that would produce unreliable results.

2. WHEN an image is processed, THE System SHALL assess face size relative to image dimensions
3. WHEN an image is analyzed, THE System SHALL detect blur using Laplacian variance
4. IF image quality is below threshold, THEN THE System SHALL reject the application with a quality error message
5. WHEN quality checks pass, THE System SHALL proceed with face detection and recognition

### Requirement 10: Results Visualization

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to see visual comparisons when duplicates are detected, so that I can verify the system's matching decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicates are detected, THE System SHALL display the uploaded photo alongside matched identity photos
2. WHEN viewing match results, THE System SHALL show the similarity score as a percentage
3. WHEN multiple matches are found, THE System SHALL rank them by confidence score
4. WHEN viewing results, THE System SHALL highlight the face regions that were compared
5. WHERE matches are uncertain, THE System SHALL allow operators to manually confirm or reject the match

### Requirement 11: Real-time Processing Updates

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to see real-time updates while my application is being processed, so that I know the system is working and can track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application is submitted, THE System SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for status updates
2. WHEN processing stages complete, THE System SHALL send progress updates to the frontend
3. WHEN processing completes, THE System SHALL send the final results through the WebSocket
