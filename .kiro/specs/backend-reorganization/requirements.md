# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reorganizing the Face Authentication and De-duplication System project structure. The backend code is currently at the root level, and we need to move it into a dedicated `backend/` directory to prepare for frontend integration and maintain a clean monorepo structure.

## Glossary

- **Backend System**: The FastAPI-based face authentication and de-duplication API service
- **Project Root**: The top-level directory of the repository
- **Backend Directory**: A new `backend/` folder that will contain all backend-related code
- **Monorepo Structure**: A repository structure that contains both frontend and backend code in separate directories

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Structure Reorganization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend code organized in a dedicated directory, so that I can easily add frontend code and maintain clear separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend System SHALL be moved into a `backend/` directory at the Project Root
2. WHEN the reorganization is complete, THE Backend System SHALL maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes
3. THE Backend Directory SHALL contain all Python application code, configuration files, and backend-specific resources
4. THE Project Root SHALL contain only repository-level files (README, .gitignore, docker-compose for orchestration)

### Requirement 2: Docker Configuration Update

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker configurations updated to reflect the new structure, so that containerized deployments continue to work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend System SHALL update the Dockerfile to reference the new `backend/` directory structure
2. THE Backend System SHALL update docker-compose.yml to mount volumes from the correct paths
3. WHEN Docker containers are built, THE Backend System SHALL successfully start and serve the API
4. THE Backend System SHALL maintain all existing Docker volume mappings for storage, logs, and application code

### Requirement 3: Documentation Update

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want updated documentation that reflects the new project structure, so that I can quickly understand how to set up and run the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend System SHALL update the README.md to reflect the new directory structure
2. THE Backend System SHALL update all file path references in documentation
3. THE Backend System SHALL provide clear instructions for both backend-only and full-stack development
4. THE Backend System SHALL document the rationale for the monorepo structure

### Requirement 4: Development Workflow Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing development workflows to continue working, so that I can maintain productivity without learning new processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend System SHALL preserve all Makefile commands with updated paths
2. THE Backend System SHALL maintain the ability to run tests from the Project Root
3. THE Backend System SHALL preserve all existing scripts with updated import paths
4. WHEN running `make up`, THE Backend System SHALL start successfully with the new structure

### Requirement 5: Path Reference Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all internal path references updated automatically, so that the application runs without manual configuration changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend System SHALL update all relative import paths in Python code
2. THE Backend System SHALL update all file path references in configuration files
3. THE Backend System SHALL update storage paths to maintain data persistence
4. THE Backend System SHALL update log file paths to maintain logging functionality
5. WHEN the Backend System starts, THE Backend System SHALL successfully access all required files and directories
