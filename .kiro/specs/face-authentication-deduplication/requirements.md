# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-enabled face authentication and de-duplication system designed for large-scale public examinations in India. The system aims to ensure fair, transparent, and merit-based candidate selection by preventing duplicate registrations and verifying applicant identities through advanced facial recognition technology. The solution must handle high volumes of applications while maintaining security, accuracy, and scalability.

## Glossary

- **Face Authentication System**: The AI-powered application that performs facial verification and de-duplication operations
- **Applicant**: An individual submitting an application for a public examination
- **Application Record**: A digital record containing applicant demographic data and facial photograph
- **Historical Database**: The centralized repository storing all previous Application Records
- **De-duplication Process**: The automated procedure that identifies multiple applications from the same individual
- **One-to-Many Matching**: A facial recognition technique comparing one face against multiple faces in a database
- **Unique Applicant ID**: A single, non-transferable identifier assigned to each verified applicant
- **Verification Threshold**: The minimum confidence score required to confirm a facial match
- **Duplicate Registration**: Multiple applications submitted by the same individual within a defined time period
- **Facial Embedding**: A numerical vector representation of facial features used for comparison

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an examination administrator, I want the system to automatically detect duplicate applications from the same individual, so that I can ensure fair and merit-based candidate selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Applicant submits a new Application Record, THE Face Authentication System SHALL extract facial features from the submitted photograph and generate a Facial Embedding
2. THE Face Authentication System SHALL perform One-to-Many Matching by comparing the generated Facial Embedding against all Facial Embeddings in the Historical Database
3. IF the comparison yields a match score exceeding the Verification Threshold, THEN THE Face Authentication System SHALL flag the Application Record as a potential Duplicate Registration
4. THE Face Authentication System SHALL complete the De-duplication Process for a single Application Record within 5 seconds under normal load conditions
5. THE Face Authentication System SHALL maintain a match accuracy rate of at least 99.5 percent for detecting Duplicate Registrations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an examination administrator, I want each verified applicant to receive a single unique identifier, so that I can prevent multiple registrations and maintain application integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Application Record passes the De-duplication Process without matches, THE Face Authentication System SHALL generate a new Unique Applicant ID
2. THE Face Authentication System SHALL ensure that each Unique Applicant ID is cryptographically unique and non-guessable
3. IF an Application Record is identified as a Duplicate Registration, THEN THE Face Authentication System SHALL retrieve the existing Unique Applicant ID associated with the matched record
4. THE Face Authentication System SHALL store the association between the Unique Applicant ID and the Facial Embedding in the Historical Database
5. THE Face Authentication System SHALL prevent the issuance of multiple Unique Applicant IDs to the same individual across all applications within the defined time period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an examination administrator, I want the system to handle high volumes of applications efficiently, so that I can process large-scale examinations without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Face Authentication System SHALL process at least 10,000 Application Records per hour during peak load periods
2. THE Face Authentication System SHALL scale horizontally to accommodate increased application volumes without degradation of performance
3. WHEN the Historical Database contains 10 million or more Facial Embeddings, THE Face Authentication System SHALL maintain the 5-second processing time requirement for One-to-Many Matching
4. THE Face Authentication System SHALL implement efficient indexing mechanisms to optimize facial similarity searches across the Historical Database
5. THE Face Authentication System SHALL provide real-time status updates on processing progress for batch operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want applicant data and facial biometrics to be protected with strong encryption, so that I can prevent unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Face Authentication System SHALL encrypt all Facial Embeddings using AES-256 encryption before storing them in the Historical Database
2. THE Face Authentication System SHALL encrypt all Application Record data in transit using TLS 1.3 or higher
3. THE Face Authentication System SHALL implement role-based access control with multi-factor authentication for all administrative functions
4. THE Face Authentication System SHALL generate audit logs for all access attempts, modifications, and De-duplication Process executions
5. THE Face Authentication System SHALL comply with applicable data protection regulations including retention and deletion requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an examination administrator, I want to review flagged duplicate cases with supporting evidence, so that I can make informed decisions on application validity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Face Authentication System flags a Duplicate Registration, THE Face Authentication System SHALL present a comparison view showing both the new and matched Application Records
2. THE Face Authentication System SHALL display the match confidence score as a percentage for each flagged Duplicate Registration
3. THE Face Authentication System SHALL provide visual similarity indicators highlighting matching facial features between photographs
4. THE Face Authentication System SHALL allow authorized administrators to override automatic duplicate flags with documented justification
5. THE Face Authentication System SHALL maintain a complete audit trail of all manual override decisions including timestamp and administrator identity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and error handling capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and quickly resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photograph fails quality checks, THE Face Authentication System SHALL reject the Application Record with a specific error message indicating the quality issue
2. THE Face Authentication System SHALL implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures during De-duplication Process
3. THE Face Authentication System SHALL alert system administrators within 2 minutes when error rates exceed 1 percent of processed applications
4. THE Face Authentication System SHALL maintain system availability of at least 99.9 percent during operational hours
5. THE Face Authentication System SHALL log all errors with sufficient context to enable root cause analysis and resolution
